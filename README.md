## Prerequisites
This software was developed on Windows 11. It should work on Windows 10, if not, reach out to me. You will also need an ElevenLabs API key. [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io) is a paid service used to generate the AI audio for the voices. You will also need a voice ID from ElevenLabs. You can get a voice from their voice library, or make your own. Now, to use use the program as a microphone for applications, you'll need to download. [VBCable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/). You can hear the audio and everything without it but to turn it into a microphone you need to download [VBCable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/). I am working on my own virtual microphone at the moment, but in the meanwhile, you will need to use [VBCable](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).
