It's designed for users looking to have fun with voice modifications and for developers interested in exploring voice synthesis and transformation technologies.

This software was developed and is intended for use on Windows machines. This was developed in Windows 11 in VSCode. It should work on Windows 10, if not, reach out to me. You will also need an ElevenLabs API key. [Elevenlabs](https://elevenlabs.io) is a paid service used to make the voices. You will also need a voice ID from ElevenLabs. You can get avoice from their voice library, or make your own.
